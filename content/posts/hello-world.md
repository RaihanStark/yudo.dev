## Introduction
I don't really know exactly what am I gonna do with this blog. Probably just for sharing my thoughts, practicing my english writing skill, showcasing my works, journaling my life or development progress, and other stuff... 

## Why?
As I said before, I will use this platform to express anything while learning english by reviewing previous post and evaluating if I got a grammar error or not - I'm not using grammarly BTW)

Also, I'm not going to do full professional like a lecturer explaining things to sleepyhead right here, I will keep this blog as personal as possible. Tell a couple jokes to make sure I didn't fall into socially-awkward-programmer-who-got-no-friend type of people.

## It will damaging your professional image if you write casually here
Nah, I don't think they will care about my opinion in this blog. I hate politics anyway.

## No one will read your blog anyway.
EXACTLY.
